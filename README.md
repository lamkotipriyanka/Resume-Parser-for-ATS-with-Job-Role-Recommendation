# Resume-Parser-for-ATS-with-Job-Role-Recommendation
This project aims to build a resume parser that first uses NLP to scan for information that are relevant to recruiters.The next part will then be to build a system to match the parsed information with several job desriptions to see where exactly the candidate fits best.
